## Notes to Share
- Code will be released here.
- In contrast to existing zero-shot methods, our free-lunch method necessitates no training, fine-tuning, text conditioning, or hyperparameter adjustments. It builds on well-established "image editing" frameworks. Yet, it diverges from existing methods as they rely on posterior approximation, degradation assumption, or loss functions to minimize during inference **(Section 2. Related Work)**. **We aimed to solve without assumptions/approximations and optimizations with prescribed loss.**
